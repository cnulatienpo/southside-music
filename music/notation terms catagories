we’re not teaching “music theory.”
we’re teaching how to write those 214 concepts on a page.

that means we need a system that does three jobs:

1. classify each term as either:

A notatable symbol (flat, staccato, trill, barline, etc.)

A concept that maps to a notatable behavior (syncopation, cadence delay, motif, interval, etc.)

A concept that has no symbol and must be expressed with layout, text, or structure (genre rules, arrangement map, EDM build-drop, etc.)

2. convert every concept into one of four notation outputs:

glyph

marking

pattern

layout rule

3. build lessons that teach the player how to notate THAT category.

not all terms need a symbol—many need a notation strategy.

so the first thing we do is divide the 214 terms into the correct buckets.
once they’re in buckets, we build the teaching system for each bucket.

I’ll show you how this works by doing the first pass:
we classify your entire list into the correct notation category.

STEP 1 — THE NOTATION BUCKET SYSTEM

every musical idea can be notated using only 8 buckets:

BUCKET A — single symbols

these are things with real, existing notation glyphs.

accidental

flat

natural

sharp

marcato

staccato

slur

tie

trill

fermata

rest

whole note

quarter note

eighth note

eighth rest

ledger line

bar (measure)

treble clef

bass clef

cut time

forte

mezzo piano

sforzando

etc.

BUCKET B — annotated text markings

concept = word appears above/below the staff.

Allegro

Andante

Moderato

Rubato

Vibrato

Pizzicato

Tutti

Tempo Marking

Dynamic Micro-Inflection (text)

Articulation variants (text)

Soprano / Baritone / Contralto (range labels)

Drone (text)

Drone Bass (text)

Octave (8va, 8vb)

BUCKET C — pattern-based notation

concept = notated through repeated shapes, accents, spacing, beams, or groupings.

Arpeggio

Glissando

Call-and-Response

Motif Construction

Motif Manipulation

Groove Types

Syncopation Systems

Subdivision Logic

Ostinato

Pivot Riff

Counterpoint Behavior

Contrary Motion

Harmonic Rhythm

Interlocking Rhythms

Repetition Patterns

Rhythmic Density Curves

Tremolo / trill-like lines

BUCKET D — structural layout

concept = notated through the shape of the score, form sections, spacing, and big markers.

Arrangement Map

Classical Form Grammar

Pop Form Grammar

Phrase Types

Phrase Length Logic

Section Functions

Hyper-Metric Reset

Metric Fake-Out

Texture Types

Texture Swaps

Texture Shifts as Form Markers

Developmental Arcs

Density vs Volume

Large-Scale Symmetry vs Asymmetry

Cyclic Motif Return

BUCKET E — harmonic symbols / numeric notation

concept = notated through chord symbols, Roman numerals, accidentals.

Augmented

Diminished

Major

Minor

Triad

Tritone

Figured Bass

Local Harmonic Function

Functional Harmony

Modal Harmony

Modulation Types

Key Signature

Transposition

Whole Step

Half Step

Interval

Chromatic

Chromatic Strategy

BUCKET F — dynamic contour notation

concept = notated with hairpins, cresc/decresc, sfz behavior.

Cresc and Decresc Placement

Dynamic Fake-Outs

Micro Dynamic Shaping

Macro Dynamic Arc

Sforzando Variants

Forte (Soul-Belt Variant)

Mezzo Piano

Dynamic Micro-Inflection

BUCKET G — special technique notation

concept = written with special symbols, articulations, text, or hybrid glyphs.

Appoggiatura

Staccato (Funk Variant)

Legato (Soul Glide Variant)

Slur Variants

Ghost Notes

Ghost Chorus

Vibrato

Tremolo

Glissando

Tuning

Pizzicato

Attack Types

Timbre Distortion

Timbre Layering Grammar

Timbre as Section Signal

BUCKET H — cannot be notated directly (meta-ideas)

concept = explained through analysis, arrangement, or descriptive text, not symbols.

these still get taught, but not through notation glyphs:

Architectural Analogy

Diegesis

Mimesis

Genre (Cross-Pollination Logic)

Hip-Hop Structural Grammar

Dance–Music Relationship

EDM Build–Drop Grammar

Metal Riff Grammar

Soul-Pop Allegro Variant

House Variants

Narrative–Music Mapping

Visual Rhythm Mapping

Prosody Alignment

Game-Logic Equivalents

Instrument Roles

Orchestration Patterns

Sectional Energy Anchors

Mix Energy Curves

Layering Strategy

Track Stacking Rules

Band Interaction Structure

STEP 2 — every bucket will get its own teaching system

I’ll show you the first.
take BUCKET A — single symbols.

these get taught like this:

1. show the actual symbol (glyph)

♭ ♯ ♮ 𝄐 𝄞 𝄢 𝄶 etc.

2. show the “structural rule”

like:
♭ lowers a note by one half-step.
𝄐 holds a note beyond its written duration.

3. show the “visual behavior”

where it sits, how it attaches, how it affects nearby symbols.

4. give a puzzle

you drag symbols to notes to satisfy conditions.

5. give production

you draw or place the symbol yourself.

6. give interpretation

you read a line with those symbols and answer questions.

the entire lesson is form → behavior → use → verify → apply.
