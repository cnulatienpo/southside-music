# Southside School of Music

A modular, sensory-first, humor-rich music education playground starring **Chela**, the blue heeler with a traffic-sign guitar. Built with React, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui primitives—destined for a future GameMaker port.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server is powered by Vite. Visit the printed URL and meet Chela on the dark-mode home screen.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the local development server
- `npm run build` – type-check and produce a production build
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS with a brutalist/industrial flavor
- shadcn/ui utilities for future component scaffolding
- Tone.js (optional) for audio experiments down the road

## Project Structure

```

## Theme & Tone

- Default dark mode (`bg-ink`)
- Monospaced, industrial typography
- Dry, referential humor with embodied, sensory-first copy—think goth Richard Scarry.
