# Southside School of Music 🎸🐕

This is a visual + kinesthetic music theory game designed for total beginners who love music but feel locked out. Built in GameMaker Studio, this project teaches players to hear, build, and write songs using:

- 🎧 Audio mini-games and call/response challenges
- 🧠 Pop culture-based theory cards (no jargon, explain-like-I’m-5)
- 🐕 Chela the Blue Heeler as your musical guide
- 🏗 A modular UI where every element is learnable and expressive
- 🎛 The goal: Build your first in-game album from scratch

## Features
- Learn beat, form, riffs, harmony, structure, and lyrics
- Navigate a world of genre hubs (metal, blues, goth, house, funk, etc.)
- Play with layering, composition, and distortion
- Unlock voiceovers, samples, gear, and lore
- Build your own studio and band
