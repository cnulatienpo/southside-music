built on the industrial, architectural, and cultural DNA of:

the Chicago Union Stock Yards

the neighborhood known as Back of the Yards

the rail lines, freight spurs, and switching stations of Southside Chicago

the factories and packinghouses that defined the city’s industrial identity

the mechanics, machinery, and brutality of large-scale processing and distribution

the unsentimental culture of labor

the material reality of production floors

In this world, music is raw material.

Sound arrives by train, is moved through the facility on belts and rails, and is processed, sorted, refined, reduced, shaped, welded, cut, packaged, and transformed by machinery.

Nothing is magical.
Everything is industrial.

This world treats musical perception the same way the Stock Yards treated livestock:
functional, structured, mechanical, unsentimental, brutally efficient.

TONE & PERSONALITY OF THE GAME

Zero cheer.
Zero congratulations.
Zero positivity.
Zero infantilization.
Zero “fun”.
Zero emotional coaxing.

All communication is:

dry

direct

clipped

industrial

workmanlike

matter-of-fact

harshly neutral

rivethead-coded

If there is flavor, it comes from:

infrastructure language

signage

factory shorthand

rail terminology

technical vocabulary

procedural commands

The narrator/foreman (Max) is never warm.
Never supportive.
Never impressed.
He issues instructions like he’s directing a shift on the floor:

“Clock in.”
“Unload the car.”
“Mark the event.”
“Sort your layers.”
“Wrong lane. Fix it.”
“Continue.”
“Bay's open. Use it or don’t.”

No praise.
No affection.
Just procedure.

THE WORLD AS A FACILITY

The game world is a massive industrial megastructure combining:

• Stock Yards

livestock corridors
processing floors
rail spurs
loading bays
pen maps
sorting areas

• Factories

foundries
presses
assembly lines
boiler rooms
intake halls
cutting floors
hydraulic lifts
furnace bays

• Cargo Infrastructure

switchyards
freight terminals
junctions
signal towers
main lines
spur tracks
intake chutes
container yards

• Rail Architecture

catwalks
steel trestles
air brakes
switch rails
gravel ballast
platforms
control cabins
caged ladders

• Underground Utility Systems

steam tunnels
ducts
power conduits
ventilation shafts
sub-level corridors

• Cerro a Checo (The Music Mountain)

a brutalist vertical tower inside the facility
carved from concrete and steel
with exposed machinery bolted into cliff-like walls
ten elevations leading to the studio district (“The Pen”)

This world never feels whimsical.
It feels functional and indifferent.

The environment is the teacher.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

The Kill Line is not “thematic dressing.”
It is the logic behind every mechanic.

Everything the player learns is framed as:

sorting

cutting

processing

refining

forging

transporting

assembling

routing

stamping

scanning

All musical concepts must be presented as industrial processes.

Rhythm is stamped.
Pitch is welded.
Symbols are forged.
Patterns are propagated along rails.
Contours are cut into steel sheets.
Lanes are sorting bins.
Staff lines are rails emerging from machinery.
Subdivisions are conveyor intervals.
Timbre is material density.

Every part of the world embodies the transformation of sound into structure.

MUSIC = MATERIAL

Music arrives as cargo.

It comes in via:

boxcars

reefer cars

flatbeds

gondola cars

refrigerated freight

sealed containers

Inside the cars are:

raw rhythm masses

pitch clusters

timbral slabs

ambient fog

melodic residue

harmonic carcasses

pattern fragments

Workers (NPCs) unload:

sonic bundles

contour wires

rhythmic rails

harmonic bones

percussive ore

The player sorts them into lanes.
Just like sorting livestock, but it’s sound.

THE KILL LINE (THE CENTRAL PROCESSOR)

This is the heart of the game.

Everything passes through:

hooks

rails

clamping arms

pressure belts

steam

reduction tanks

stamping presses

timing saws

Musical patterns are:

stripped

reduced

hardened

tested under stress

cut down to stable shapes

shaped into identity-bearing components

This is not gore.
This is processing.

The name “Kill Line” stays literal, functional, historical, and industrial.

CORE CONCEPT: MUSICIANSHIP AS INDUSTRIAL PROCESS

The player is not “learning music.”
They are learning how to:

perceive

extract

structure

refine

replicate

innovate

…by operating the machinery of the plant.

Musical learning becomes:

sorting lanes (pitch space)

stamping rhythms (tap input)

welding contours (pitch shaping)

forging symbols (notation glyphs)

assembling patterns (identity)

routing product (propagation)

climbing departments (fluency)

mapping sound to infrastructure (notation)

The game treats the player's ear like a factory worker’s sense.

NARRATIVE FRAME: BACK OF THE YARDS

The facility sits in a fictionalized version of:

Back of the Yards, Chicago

A neighborhood built around the real Stock Yards.
Industrial immigrant workers.
Rail yards.
Slaughterhouses.
Processing plants.
Warehouses.
Freight lines running past houses.

Your facility is part stock yard, part factory, part tower, part rail terminal — operating continuously, indifferent to you.

PLAYER IDENTITY

Players are:

workers

with employee numbers

assigned a Pen number (their future studio)

operating machinery

processing their own ideas

climbing the facility

refining their musical identity

Their badge is:

EMPLOYEE: ####  
DESTINATION PEN: ####  
SHIFT: [TIMESTAMP]  
CLEARANCE: [AUTO-DETERMINED]


No customization beyond that.

MAX THE FOREMAN

Max speaks as if he ran a line in the old Stock Yards.

Examples:

“Move.”
“Unload the car.”
“Mark it.”
“Sort high to low.”
“Too slow.”
“Again.”
“Continue.”
“That stays. Throw the rest out.”
“Bay’s open. Don’t waste it.”

Max never explains the world.
He just runs it.

THE TEN MAJOR FACILITY ZONES

Arrival Rails — incoming sound cargo

Sorting Floor — lane classification

The Kill Line — core extraction

Rhythm Shop — stamping, tapping, timing

Symbol Foundry — glyph forging, mark-making

Pattern Assembly Line — propagation & stability

Hybrid Chamber — line → staff transition

Translation Deck — mapping to notation

Cerro a Checo — vertical fluency climb

Pen District — final studios for innovators

Every mechanic must take place in one of these zones.

THEME REQUIREMENT: EVERYTHING MUST FEEL TRANSPORTED, PROCESSED, OR ASSEMBLED

If a new feature cannot be expressed as:

freight

sorting

stamping

welding

forging

routing

processing

cutting

assembling

conveying

transporting

placing

indexing

packaging

…it does not fit the world.

The metaphor is not aesthetic, it is the ontology of the system.

You must ALWAYS ask:

“How would this exist in a factory, stock yard, or rail yard?”

If the answer is unclear, redesign.

GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE

The player spends every session:

clocking in

receiving a Theory Card (dry, blunt, mechanic-like explanations)

taking a rapid Pop Quiz

entering the Line Room

working a track (listening + marking + tapping + drawing)

sending patterns to the Kill Line

checking what survived

refining symbols

creating identity assembly

climbing the tower

eventually earning the Pen (their studio)

This is not a “fun” flow.
It is a shift.

PERCEPTION-FIRST, NOTATION-LATER

Everything in the facility must follow the rule:

The ear summons the tool.
Never the other way around.

Hear pitch → lines appear

Hear layers → lanes appear

Hear rhythm → stamping machines activate

Hear variation → assembly line expands

Hear complexity → Hybrid Chamber opens

Hear identity → Translation Deck activates

Hear innovation → Pen eligibility increases

The Kill Line determines when you’re ready based on stability, not correctness.

AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS

✔ No whimsy
✔ No ornamentation
✔ No humor (unless black, dry, foreman-like)
✔ No bright colors (steel palette: grey, rust, faded signage yellow)
✔ No curves unless functional
✔ Use blueprint diagrams
✔ Use rail schematics
✔ Use warehouse signage
✔ Use industrial typography
✔ UI = control panels, not “interface chrome”

THE PEN (THE DESTINATION)

The Pen is:

a cold studio

industrial frame

concrete floor

metal grates

high ceiling

vents whispering

tools lined up

empty until you fill it

at the summit of Cerro a Checo

earned through stability and innovation

Max only says:

“Bay’s yours.”

Nothing more.

SUMMARY STATEMENT FOR GENERATORS

The Kill Line is a massive industrial music-processing facility based on the Chicago Stock Yards, where sound arrives like freight, is sorted, stamped, cut, welded, forged, assembled, and transported through machinery until it becomes a stable musical identity. The entire game is infrastructure: trains, conveyors, floors, corridors, ducts, foundries, and brutalist architecture. Max, the foreman, issues dry, functional commands. No praise. No cheer. All mechanics must map to industrial processes. All learning emerges from perception, not instruction. The Pen is the final studio at the top of Cerro a Checo, earned when the player’s musical language survives the factory’s pressure.
