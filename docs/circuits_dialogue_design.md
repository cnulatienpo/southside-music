# Circuits Dialogue & Flavor System

## Overview
Circuits uses NPCs + urban locales to frame micro-situations. Players get casual chatter, soft nudges, and believable excuses for why only a few tools are around. Everything is framed as hanging out in the city, not passing a test.

## Why Non-Musician NPCs?
Because learning music comes from the world, not a classroom. Bodega owners, janitors, drivers, and barbers keep the tone grounded and relatable while still cheering you on.

## Dialogue Tone
- casual
- grounded
- funny
- supportive
- zero-judgment

## Example Exchanges
- NPC: "Hit that button again. Yeah, that kinda wobbles. Try it."
- NPC: "Sound higher? Lower? I dunno, play with it."
- NPC: "Alright, cool. You heading out or staying?"

## Constraints
Always explained with an excuse, never a rule. Broken machines, missing cables, or city noise become in-world reasons you only have certain tools.

## 2D Scene Variety
Scenes rely on silhouettes + simple industrial/urban backgrounds. Rooftops, tunnels, bodega counters, laundromats, and other low-key corners keep things fresh without needing complex assets.
