## 1. Why Ear Training Matters
Ear training here is learning to notice, like feeling the breeze change before a storm. It is learning to track motion, like watching a kite pull its string forward or slump back. It is learning to feel direction, like sensing which way an escalator moves when your eyes are closed. We don’t grade, we don’t rank. Listening is a body skill, not a brain quiz. You wiggle, you touch the sound, you let your skin and chest and spine tell you where it went. If you’re waiting for a scorecard, you won’t find it. “Not for nothin’, just play. I’m not gonna tell you if you got it wrong or right. Don’t be like that.”

## 2. The Four Modes of the Dojo

### Mode 1 — Classic, Silent Conservatory
- **Same/Different:** Imagine two pebbles in your palms. Do they feel the same weight, same smoothness, or does one tug heavier? That’s the game.
- **Up/Down:** Picture a finger drawing a line upward on your arm or tracing down your shoulder. Sounds lean upward or slide downward the same way.
- **Closer/Farther:** One footstep lands near your toes; another lands down the hallway. Feel which sound is nearer, which is distant.
- **Contour Following:** Trace the edge of a wave with your hand. The line curls up, dips, rises again. Sound shapes do that too; you follow the curve.
- **Rhythmic Echo:** Someone taps a pattern on your back. You mirror it. No words, just pattern.
- **Pulse Tapping:** Tap your heart beat on your thigh. Keep that walk steady and the sound walks with you.
Each drill is a shape, a line, a body cue. You move with the sound and let your body sketch what you hear.

### Mode 2 — Your Own Language
“Talk how YOU talk. The game listens first. Theory comes later.” Call a guitar’s swoop “WHEEE-WHOMP.” Say the drums “fall forward.” Tell us the bass “steps heavy.” Maybe the piano “glitters like broken glass” or the singer “slides like soap.” All descriptions welcome; the game collects your words like stickers on a guitar case.

### Mode 3 — Adaptive Challenge
The contrasts start big—stones of different weights in each hand. Then they shrink: two pebbles almost the same. The game watches patterns, not correctness. If you keep noticing the light stone first, it’ll hand you closer weights. Your senses sharpen like adjusting focus on a camera.

### Mode 4 — Real-World Listening
This is practice inside actual songs. “Did the bass move?” “Where did the singer breathe?” “What changed at 0:48?” It’s like walking into a room blindfolded and naming where the couch is by touch. We dip into real tracks and feel shifts, breaths, and steps in the music.

## 3. The Three Pillars of Ear Training

### Pillar 1 — Train the Attention
Same/different, up/down, near/far, contour. Lift your hand; feel it rise. Step closer; notice the air shrink. Watch a ball bounce—up, arc, down. That’s the motion your ears will trace. Attention is your flashlight.

### Pillar 2 — Train the Body
Tap pulse like a heartbeat on your chest. Echo rhythms like tossing a ball back and forth. Follow gestures with your arm as if you’re shadowing a dancer. Rhythm lives in calves, wrists, and breath; the body is the metronome.

### Pillar 3 — Train the Memory
“Which came first?” is like spotting which of two lights blinked before the other. “What changed?” is like noticing one backpack suddenly feels heavier. Short-term auditory memory is a handprint in wet clay—you press, you feel, it holds for a moment.

## 4. Safe Space Dojo Rules
- No right/wrong.
- No tests.
- No scores.
- No comparison.
- No embarrassment.
- Only noticing, exploring, describing.
“Not for nothin’, but this game ain’t like that.”

## 5. Exercise Chapters (Long Form)

### Same / Different
Imagine two stones in your palms. Roll them with your fingers. One is smooth like river glass; the other has a tiny ridge. Sounds do that too. Sometimes both stones weigh the same and you grin because they match. Sometimes one is colder, heavier, or has a hidden corner. The exercise asks: do these two sonic stones feel like twins or cousins? Feel texture, weight, and the way they move when you tilt your hands.

### Up / Down
Think of a paintbrush sliding up a wall—light pressure, climbing—and then swooping down like a curtain falling. A sound can rise like stretching tall on tiptoes or sink like sitting into a couch. Your job: sense the incline or decline. Feel your own spine lengthen or curl as you listen.

### Near / Far
One voice whispers inches from your ear; another shouts from the other side of the field. One drumbeat feels like it taps your knee; another sounds like it’s behind a door. You measure distance with your skin: cozy closeness or roomy space. Name the closeness, name the distance.

### Contour
Picture a wave: climb, crest, slide. Picture a staircase: step up, step up, rest, step down. A melody’s path is a drawn line—no numbers, just shape. Run your finger in the air to match the rises and dips. Does it bump like hills or glide like a skate ramp? Follow the curve.

### Rhythmic Echo
Someone claps a pattern—tap, tap, pause, tap—and you answer back like a friendly echo in a canyon. Breathe with it; feel the inhale on the pause and the exhale on the tap. The exercise is call-and-response through breath and hands.

### Pulse Tapping
There is a steady footstep under everything, like a friend walking beside you. Tap it on your thigh, stomp it softly, or nod your head. Keep the pulse steady like a train on rails. When the music shifts, see if the rails bend or stay straight.

### Gesture Matching
A sound swoops; you draw that swoop in the air with your hand. A line jerks; your wrist jerks too. You are mirroring movement, like dancing with someone who leads gently. The better you mirror, the clearer you feel the sound’s muscle memory.

### Which First?
Two footprints appear in wet sand. Which print landed first? Two lights blink; which sparked before the other? You listen for order, like tracking which domino fell before the next. Keep it playful—just point to “first” without stress.

### What Changed?
Hold two bags of rice; one suddenly feels heavier. Look at two lamps; one gets brighter. Listen to a pattern; something shifts—maybe weight, maybe brightness, maybe a tiny bend upward. You describe the change: heavier, lighter, brighter, dimmer, closer, further, quicker, slower.

## 6. When Terminology Appears
Terms are shy and only peek out after you’ve played through 30+ events. Only when you’re ready. Example reveals: “You’re kinda describing what musicians call ‘contour’, btw.” “That feeling you noticed? Musicians call that tension.” “You’re hearing the downbeat.” The tone stays gentle; no lectures, just friendly nods to the words other folks use.

---

## 7. How Adaptive Learning Works (Human Terms)
The game notices patterns: what you describe, where you pause, what you catch easily. It nudges difficulty like a friend sliding the couch an inch closer or farther to see if you still sense it. Contrasts shrink or widen. No judgment ever, just a workout buddy turning the dial as you get stronger.

---

## 8. Visual Mode (For Deaf Users)
Shapes move when pitch rises or falls: lines lift like kites or sink like leaves. Beats pulse as circles expanding and contracting, like breathing dots. Textures thicken as shading grows dense or grainy. Contour lines trace the path—smooth waves, sharp zigzags. Tapping is shown as lights blinking in steady steps. Rhythm echo becomes patterns of flashes you mirror with your hands or eyes.

---

## 9. Audio Mode (For Hearing Users)
You match sounds like matching footprints in mud. You tap pulse with fingers, feet, or chest. You echo rhythms by breathing and clapping back. You let your ear feel motion—rising, falling, leaning forward, leaning back.

---

## 10. Dual-Mode Practice
Use visuals + gestures + sound together. Watch a line rise while you slide your hand up and hum or imagine the lift. Feel a pulse in your feet while lights blink in time. Hybrid examples: trace the contour on screen with your finger while nodding to the beat; clap the rhythm you see as blocks and hear as drums; lean forward when the bass steps heavy and watch the shape thicken.

## 12. Mini-Chapter: Using Your Own Language
Describe music in your own words. The game learns your dialect the way a friend learns your slang. Say the bass “tip-toed,” the snare “jumped ahead,” the synth “melted upward,” the vocals “hung in the air like fog,” the guitar “scratched like denim,” the piano “dripped like honey.” Your words steer the practice. As you play, the system matches your metaphors to its shapes, adapting to your phrases instead of forcing new ones.

---

## 13. Closing Chapter: Listen With Your Whole Body
Listening is movement. It’s attention stretching like yoga, breath syncing with pulse, skin catching vibrations like sunlight. Music is a physical event—air shifting, bodies resonating, rooms breathing. Let your whole body be the antenna. Walk, sway, tap, and let the sounds paint motion through you. The Dojo is not about right or wrong; it’s about feeling the world vibrate and answering back with your own motion.
