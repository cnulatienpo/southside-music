# Circuits Meta Rewards & Souvenir System

## Philosophy
- No points
- No grades
- No stars or medals
- Just expression + memory

## Souvenirs
Small artifacts representing:
- scenes you visited
- vibes you passed through
- people you met
- sounds you touched

Souvenirs are graffiti-style mementos: stickers, scraps, ticket stubs, contour sketches, or quotes. They sit in your pocket without judging how you played.

## Trophy Tags
- Flavor-only
- Personality markers
- Memes of your choices

Tags mirror the vibe of a run ("Night Owl", "Wandering Ear", "Bass Goblin") without measuring correctness or comparing you to anyone.

## Run Replay
- Re-experience a run without correctness
- Browse expressive summaries of past chains
- Drop back into any node just to feel the vibe again

## Why This Matters
This makes the game feel alive and personal without turning it into a scoreboard or performance test. Players leave with memories, not grades.
