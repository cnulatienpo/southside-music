# THE GARDEN — Urban Greenhouse Mode

## Tone
- Industrial greenhouse built from concrete, glass, and neon wiring
- Cracked concrete walkways with puddles reflecting sodium streetlights
- Flickering signs, humming transformers, and steam vents
- Alley creativity fueled by scraps, loops, and found noise
- Metal ribs, vines of cables, flowers of distortion and buzz

## Role
The Garden is where songs grow crooked and wild. Players improvise in a gritty greenhouse, stacking textures, bending shapes, and letting accidents blossom into ideas.

## Core Activities
- **Jam Mode:** Live play with gestures (drawing, tapping, humming) mirrored in sound and shape.
- **Visual songwriting:** Sketch structures on cracked grids; shapes glow like neon and drive audio.
- **Audio-only songwriting:** Layer bass rumbles, chain percussion, and ducts of drone without touching visuals.
- **Soundworld building:** Spawn and sculpt industrial elements (pipes, hisses, buzz pads, duct drones).
- **Lyric meditation:** Rooftop notebook moments with sirens and train hum in the distance.
- **Improvisational shaping:** Break, layer, mutate, and rebuild motifs with no grading and no perfectionism.

## Seed Example
“I want something that feels like subway wind and sodium streetlights.”

## Soundworld Palette
- Metal pipes
- Air ducts
- Chain percussion
- Shop fan drones
- Neon hum pads
- Subway-rumble bass layers
- CRT static bursts
- Crosswalk beep rhythms
- Manhole echo reverb tails

## Dual-Mode Interaction
- Draw shapes → hear them as clanking rhythms, buzzing pads, or sliding bass forms.
- Tap/hum beats → see them appear as vibrating neon lines and puddle ripples.

## Philosophy
This is PLAY:
- Build
- Layer
- Mutate
- Discover
- Break and rebuild
