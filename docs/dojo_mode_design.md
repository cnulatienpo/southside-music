# DOJO MODE — Urban Training Hall

## Tone & Vibe
- Industrial practice space
- Minimal, gritty, quiet
- Concrete, metal, flicker-lights
- Built for repetition and skill-building

## Purpose
This is where the player sharpens the fundamentals: ear, timing, voice, contour, octaves, pitch, note-color.

## Environment
- A reclaimed factory space
- Scuffed floor markings
- Dented lockers
- Distant train-rumble

## Activities
- attention drills
- rhythm practice
- vocal shaping
- instrument technique
- contour tracing
- octave recognition
- note-color sensitivity

## Philosophy
- no grades
- no shame
- no pressure
- slow improvement over time
- repetition without judgment

## Examples of Dojo Prompts
- "Follow this shape like tracing graffiti on a brick wall."
- "Tap where the beat hits the floor."
- "Does this line rise like a streetlight buzz or fall like subway rumble?"

## Integration
- Dojo works with EarTrainingEngine + Pitch Ladder
- All drills feed silent-mastery maps
