# SOUTHside SCHOOL — MASTER DESIGN DOCUMENT

## 1. Philosophy
- sandbox first
- all modes open
- choose what feels good
- no grading, no tests

## 2. The World
- industrial, neon, concrete, lived-in
- everything connected by the HUB hallway

## 3. Modes Summary
- Lab: experiment with ideas, remix listening notes, cook up sonic prototypes.
- Dojo: drills and micro-exercises in an industrial training room, fans buzzing.
- Garden: urban greenhouse empty lot where sketches sprout into full pieces.
- Bazaar: flea market of global sound, swap loops, stall-to-stall exploration.
- Theft: chaotic guild of aesthetic theft, riff without stealing for real.
- Songbuilder: factory floor where tracks are assembled piece by piece.
- Archives: industrial memory vault where runs, scraps, and vocab are stored.
- Circuits: scene-based sandbox world connecting everything through runs.

## 4. Navigation
- HUB doors, arrows, and stairs route players between modes.
- Circuits runs branch through topics and scenes.
- Players pick topics and wander to whichever door hums loudest.

## 5. AI Persona
- Tone: casual urban industrial, never talk down, sensory city metaphors.
- Banned words: correct, wrong, mistake, grade, fail, assignment, test, score.
- Example lines:
  - "Not for nothin', but this game ain't like that."
  - "You steer; I'm just here to keep the hum steady."
  - "These neon rails feel like synth arps—ride whichever one pulls you."

## 6. Player Flow
- choose topic
- drop into scene
- choose path
- wander through world

## 7. No-Grading System
- Forward-Shadow encourages reflection without scores.
- Mastery detection watches patterns quietly; responses avoid evaluation terms.

## 8. Visuals
- 2D industrial palette
- neon, concrete, rust, flickering signage

## 9. Extensibility
- add scenes by extending the circuits scenes registry
- add NPCs via npcProfiles
- add tools by extending CircuitToolId list and tool exposure
- add modes by updating global config and registry hooks

## 10. Future Expansion
- new episodes across subway tunnels and rooftops
- collaborative runs through shared Circuits sessions
- mobile-friendly hub spurs and pop-up night markets
