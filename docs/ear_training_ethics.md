# The Dojo Ethics

## The No-Grading Model
The dojo smells like pine resin and brass valves warming in the first sunlight. Nothing here is about scores; it is about how the air shifts when a tone lands and how your shoulders drop when you hear a pattern click. The philosophy is anti-shame and anti-test, all pro-growth. We move like dancers in the dark, trusting the floorboards and the hum of the room to tell us when the phrasing is breathing. No red marks, no golden stickers—just you, a melody, and a guide who listens more than they speak.

## Step-by-step explanation of all 7 steps:
1. **The game refuses to grade you.** Every input is treated as a gesture, not an exam. The system blocks any attempt to turn music into math and answers with a grin and a shrug.
2. **Exercises happen silently.** Prompts glide in without fanfare; the work is in your inner ear, not on a scoreboard.
3. **Theory comes only when you prove you hear it.** First you show the melody you already embody, then the labels arrive like late captions on a film you know by heart.
4. **Quiet skill reveals.** Mastery surfaces in how you settle into timing, how you anticipate a change before it arrives. The system notes the pattern; it never shouts approval.
5. **Soft, human accomplishment.** A nod, a "word," a "preciate you"—that’s the celebration. Casual, human, and gone before ego can latch on.
6. **Never corrects you.** When you fish for validation, the engine answers: “Not for nothin’, but this game ain’t like that. Just play.”
7. **Private map of your ear.** A living, internal cartography—no confetti, no badges. Just patterns observed, routes reopened, and new turns suggested when the groove is ready.

## How the engine tracks patterns
The system watches your phrasing like streetlights reflecting on a wet sidewalk. Maybe it notices the player hears lights better than shadows: bright intervals snap into place while darker minor colors need more breaths. Maybe it notes the player identifies ascending patterns faster than descending, always catching the lift before the fall. Latency shortens, hesitation melts, and the engine reads these shifts as secret confirmations that you are already hearing, already knowing.

## The difference between training and testing
Testing is fluorescent, sterile, and obsessed with keeping score. Training is dim lights, a subwoofer sighing, a room that invites mistakes because mistakes aren’t graded—they are just steps in the dance. Testing asks, “Are you right?” Training asks, “What changed in you when that chord turned the corner?”

## Why this works for:
- **deaf learners**: The rhythm of vibration and visual cues are honored; no shame in how the signal arrives.
- **late beginners**: No backlog of grades to fear—only a present tense invitation to play.
- **traumatized musicians**: The room is gentle, voice soft, never ranking, always observing.
- **perfectionists**: Boundaries redirect the urge to seek correctness into curiosity, letting perfection loosen its grip.

## Boundary phrase
“Not for nothin’, but this game ain’t like that.” Say it like a bass line—steady, kind, and immovable. It is the gate that keeps judgment out and keeps play inside.
