# PART 1 — THEFT MODE

## How to Rob the Fuck Out of Everything and Everyone

This mode is a criminally creative thieves’ guild for music-makers—criminal, chaotic, wild, fun, swaggering, loud, and unapologetic. Imagine robbing trains in the 1920s, pulling off alleyway heists, stealing the Mona Lisa and turning her goth, or Reservoir Dogs meeting Wax Trax.

### The Rules
- You can only steal **form, energy, context, structure, vibe, shape, reason, tension, gesture, attitude, technique**.
- Never steal **melody, lyrics, literal riffs, exact chord order, production presets, or specific identifiable art**.

### Heist Report (after every mission)
Document every theft with:
- **What you stole**
- **How much you stole**
- **Where you stole it from** (abstract descriptors only — e.g., “forest echo reverb,” “train-yard rhythm,” “Siouxsie shimmer,” “Green River snarl”)
- **Level of ruthlessness** (how far you transformed it)
- **Level of creativity**
- **Level of risk** (stealing something difficult and weird)
- **Level of shamelessness** (how unapologetically you took what you needed)
- **Level of transformation** (how much you mutated what you took)

### Highest Achievement: RUTHLESSNESS
Ruthlessness means you stole boldly, mutated brutally, and created something that honors nothing but your desire to make art. Copyright was never touched because you never lifted literal material in the first place. This is the Southside Syndicate.
