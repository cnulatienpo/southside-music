# THE LAB — Southside School of Music

## Tone & Vibe
Underground science lab energy.
  • blueprints
  • bubbling experiments
  • chalkboard diagrams
  • mad-scientist fun

## Purpose
The Lab is where you learn:
  notes, melody, harmony, rhythm, chords, form,
  instruments, production, arrangement, songwriting.

## What Happens Here
- You poke at sounds.
- You sculpt shapes.
- You run experiments.
- You break things and rebuild them.

## Boundaries
The Lab is NOT the Theft Guild.

## Plagiarism Rule (EXACT WORDING REQUIRED)

If a player attempts actual plagiarism, the game shows a pop-up:

  **"not for nothin, but that crosses the plagerism line. you do what you want, but i cant vouch for you on this one. we do aeshtetic theft, with style. not real theft, that would make you an asshole"**

## Examples
- aesthetic theft = GOOD
- literal copying = NOPE

## DeepSeek Integration
DeepSeek analyzes user words and supports:
  • experimental prompts
  • theory nudges
  • reflective questions

## Philosophy
The Lab is PLAY:
  - learning by experimenting
  - no shame
  - no pressure
  - no grading
